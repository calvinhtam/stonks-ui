# Marshall Wace UI Developer technical test

## Overview

This test has three parts:

1. Component styling
2. Vanilla TypeScript / TDD
3. React integration

Each section builds on the previous one.

The first section is required, the second and third sections are optional. After completing the first section you'll be given the choice of whether to submit your solution or proceed with the later sections.

There's no enforced time limit, however we would expect each section to take around 30-45 minutes.

## How it works

Your solution will involve editing the contents of this repository. Feel free to make git commits as you go for your own benefit; your commit history will not be included in the resulting test submission.

We've tried to make the instructions as clear as possible, so if you notice any ambiguity in the task definition (or have any other feedback that you think could improve the test) please note this down in the `FEEDBACK.md` file in the project root.

## Project setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. These are required for the project setup.

You won't need to add any additional dependencies to complete the challenge.

---

Once you have installed the project dependencies, run the following commands to update this `README.md` and proceed to the first step:

```
git fetch --all --tags
git merge --ff part1
```

Good luck!
